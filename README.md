# Blinkit-Analysis-Dashboard
I developed a comprehensive project in Excel, creating multiple dashboards and tables to analyze the data. This process involve several stages including data preprocessing, data cleaning and data visualization.
The objective of this project is to design an interactive Power BI dashboard for Blinkit that provides actionable insights into item inventory, sales performance, outlet segmentation, and customer preferences.
